# MLB Pitch Prediction Project

## Introduction

This repository contains code and analysis for predicting a pitcher's next pitch using pitch-by-pitch data from Major League Baseball (MLB). The project aims to develop a predictive model and provide insights into a pitcher's behavior.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- **sandbox_and_EDA notebook**: Initial exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset's feature distribution and familiarize with the data.

- **pitch_data.py**: Module containing a function to load the dataset into other notebooks. The module includes docstrings and exception handling to demonstrate data engineering skills.

- **dummy_results.ipynb**: Development of a dummy classifier to establish baseline predictions and set performance goals. Results and code for the dummy classifier can be found in this notebook.

- **models_and_features.ipynb**: Implementation of the predictive model and assessment of evaluation metrics. The notebook presents a model with a 0.48 accuracy and outlines next steps for improvement.

## Usage

To replicate the analysis or explore the project, follow these steps:

1. Open the Jupyter notebooks in the respective order mentioned above.
   
2. Execute the code cells to reproduce the analysis and view the results.

## Next Steps

For further development and enhancement of the project, consider the following next steps outlined in the **models_and_features.ipynb** notebook.
